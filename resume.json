But what really sets him apart is his ability to explain complex things in a way that just clicks. He's also the ultimate team player, always ready to roll up his sleeves and collaborate. If you're on the lookout for a senior software engineer who's got it all, here's Jesus.",

      "reference": "Imagine an engineer with less than a year of professional working experience more proficient than the average 5 years worker. That is Jesus. A really quick learner, he's been capable of grasping very complex architectural concepts in record time, that usually take several years to master. Among that he's been able to become an outstandingly proficient Scala programmer (not an easy language to learn when you have almost no \"real world\" programming background) in less than 6 months. Wow. Being an all terrain professional what I would stress about him is his passion for learning new things and getting deep to the bottom of everything. He feels uncomfortable in front of black magic. And that makes of Jesus a self driven, curious person that doesn't stop until everything is understood. If you hire him I warn you: as soon as I have a chance I'll try to get him back to work in my team again, so you'd better treat him well or you'll loose one of the most valuable assets in your organisation.",
